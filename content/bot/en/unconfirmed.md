This is the most important automation you can have in your hotel.

It continuously checks if there is a reservation that has been initiated, all payment data has been entered, but payment confirmation has not been received.

The customer will believe they have paid because the payment is held unconfirmed, but the payment has not been received and the reservation has not been confirmed.

Therefore, an email is sent to the hotel so they can review the reservation and confirm payment manually.

This is a common problem in hotels using Little Hotelier, as the system does not send an email to the hotel when a reservation is made without payment, especially since the implementation of PSD2 to confirm payment.
