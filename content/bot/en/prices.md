Sometimes when applying promotions or discounts, the system does not correctly update the total reservation amount.

This can lead to reservations that have paid an inaccurate amount that cannot be prorated across different days.

Therefore, the paid price and the price per night may not match, which can cause confusion and problems in reservation management.

For this reason, the reservation total is reviewed and the price displayed in FrontDesk is adjusted to match the total paid.

It is quite useful for managing invoices professionally and avoiding cent errors.

This process is performed before generating invoices automatically.
