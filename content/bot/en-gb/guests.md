Checks that the reservation data is available.
Some hotels require the guest's tax identification number to issue the invoice.
If not available, the hotel is notified to add it manually.

# Example email:

Dear hotel,

We have detected that the guest's tax identification number is missing from reservation [Reservation ID].

To issue the invoice, we need this information to be added.

Please update the reservation with the guest's tax identification number as soon as possible.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Kind regards,
Hotelier Tools
