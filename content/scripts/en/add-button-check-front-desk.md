## What does it do?

This script adds a button to check reservation details in Front Desk and review refunds.

**Features:**
- Button to check details in Front Desk
- Quick access to review refunds
- Improves navigation between sections
- Facilitates reservation management

It may be necessary to press the button twice if you are not logged into Front Desk, as the script does not check if you are connected.
